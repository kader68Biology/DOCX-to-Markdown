Todo: update using https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown
Automatic conversion between DOCX/DOC and Markdown formats.

### Workflows

### 1. Convert DOCX/DOC Files to Markdown

This workflow is triggered whenever a DOCX or DOC file is pushed to the
repository. It converts all DOCX and DOC files (case-insensitive) to
Markdown format (`.md`).

-   **Trigger:** Push events for `.docx`, `.DOCX`, `.doc`, and `.DOC`
    files.
-   **Manual Trigger:** You can also trigger the workflow manually via
    the GitHub Actions tab.
-   **Output:** Corresponding Markdown files (`.md`) for each DOCX/DOC
    file.

### 2. Convert Markdown Files to DOCX/DOC

This workflow is triggered whenever a Markdown (`.md`) file is pushed to
the repository. It converts all Markdown files (except `LICENSE.md`) to
both DOCX and DOC formats.

-   **Trigger:** Push events for `.md` files.
-   **Manual Trigger:** You can also trigger the workflow manually via
    the GitHub Actions tab.
-   **Output:** Corresponding DOCX (`.docx`) and DOC (`.doc`) files for
    each Markdown file.
